# 418 challenge notes
While I could modify an Angular sample app using Kendo UI to build a user interface to interact with the API in this challenge, I'm choosing to show screen shots from an Angular application that I've developed and is in production. The application is for Law Enforcement and has over 120 organizations with over 3000 officers using the system. Hopefully the screen shots from this application will showcase my abilities to create an Angular application.  

## Here are details of the application:
0. Angular 16 / Typescript / DOTNET 7 API's / SQL Server databases
1. Azure B2C identity provider with MSAL client
2. Progressive web app / responsive design
3. Material Design for Angular
4. Multiple libraries  
a. shell application  
b. common library  
c. Six feature libraries  
5. Multiple layers of abstraction  
a. HTML template  
b. Components  
c. Service Facades  
d. Service providers (e.g. singleton data, http services)  
6. Extensive use of RxJs  
7. Built as a container in Azure DevOps  
8. Deployed as a container in Azure Kubernetes
